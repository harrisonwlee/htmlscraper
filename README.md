# htmlscraper
This program was written to scrape the html of various websites to build data to display back to the user. 
Initially written to be used in conjunction with my ETF Symbol Data Retriever project, I found it was easier
to implement the html scraping in PHP directly rather than calling the Python function from PHP. 

Looks at https://www.spdrs.com for all ETF data.
Uses library 'BeautifulSoup' for all html data handling.
Stores retrieved data in array for easy management.
